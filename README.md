- Verify `codeLab` demo source using LICENSE `Apache version 2.0`(If we can simply provide link in our docs and redirect to these demo repos)   
- About `No existing source`, I propose to write this part from scratch  
- About source from `Oniro Docs`, I propose to reuse/(make modification based on original docs)
