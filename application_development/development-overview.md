The application development documentation serves as a comprehensive reference for building applications using the APIs provided by OpenHarmony. These guides walk you through the process of developing applications using JavaScript APIs on the standard system.

The documentation is structured as follows, following a progressive learning path from foundational concepts to advanced capabilities:

### Getting Started

Begin your OpenHarmony development journey [here](quick_start/before_start.md) by setting up your environment and understanding the core concepts of application development.

In this section, you will explore:
- The **application package structure** and how to organize project files effectively.
- **Resource file management** for handling assets efficiently.
- The **core functions and syntax of ArkTS**, OpenHarmony's key development language.
- **Application lifecycle management**, including how applications start, run, and close.
- A step-by-step guide to building your first OpenHarmony application, ensuring a solid foundation for further development.

### Core Development

To streamline your development process, we provide guidelines for implementing essential features in OpenHarmony applications.

A deep understanding of the two foundational frameworks is crucial for application development:

- **Application Framework**: Learn about different [Application Models](application-models/Readme-EN.md) and how they shape the app’s lifecycle and behavior.
- **UI Framework**: Master the fundamentals of [UI Development](ui/Readme-EN.md) using ArkUI to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **System API Integration**: Understand how to leverage OpenHarmony’s APIs for:
  - **File storage and database management**
  - **Network requests and communication**
  - **Device permissions and security management**
