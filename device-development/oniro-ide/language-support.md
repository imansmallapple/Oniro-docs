Oniro IDE is built using [Theia](https://theia-ide.org/docs/), which is heavily influenced by VS Code. The languages supported by the IDE are all those supported by VS Code. Examples of such are:

| [![Python](/Images/device-development/oniro-ide/python.png) **Python**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) | [![C/C++](/Images/device-development/oniro-ide/c-c++.png) **C/C++**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) | [![C#](/Images/device-development/oniro-ide/cs.png) **C#**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp) |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| [![Go](/Images/device-development/oniro-ide/Go.png) **Go**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go) | [![Java](/Images/device-development/oniro-ide/java.png) **Java**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java) | [<img src="/Images/device-development/oniro-ide/js.png" width="100"> **JavaScript**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript) |
